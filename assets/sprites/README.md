# Sprites Directory

This directory contains the pixel art sprites for the game.

## Player Sprite (player.png)
For now, you can use any 32x32 pixel art sprite for the player character. 
Some suggested resources:
- Create your own using Aseprite, GIMP, or any pixel art editor
- Use free sprites from itch.io or opengameart.org
- Generate using AI tools like DALL-E or Midjourney

The sprite should be:
- 32x32 pixels (or any square size that's power of 2)
- PNG format with transparency
- Pixel art style suitable for a rogue-like game

Place the player sprite as `player.png` in this directory.
